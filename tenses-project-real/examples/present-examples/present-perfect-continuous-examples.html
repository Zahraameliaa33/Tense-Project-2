  <!-- EXPLANATION FOR "I" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> I <strong>have been studying</strong> for two hours.</p>
    <p>“Have been studying” shows an action that started in the past and is still continuing or has a present effect.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Negative & Question Forms ❌❓</h4>
    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> I <strong>have not been studying</strong> for two hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Have</strong> I <strong>been studying</strong> for two hours?</p>
    <p>Use “have + not been” for negatives, and start with “Have” for questions. The verb always stays in the <strong>been + V-ing</strong> form.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- EXPLANATION FOR "You" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You <strong>have been working</strong> all day.</p>
    <p>This shows a long, continuous action happening until now.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Negative & Question Forms ❌❓</h4>
    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> You <strong>have not been working</strong> all day.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Have</strong> you <strong>been working</strong> all day?</p>
    <p>The structure stays the same: have + been + V-ing, even in negative and question forms.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- EXPLANATION FOR "They" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>

    <p>Use this to show an activity that started earlier and continues until now.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Negative & Question Forms ❌❓</h4>
    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> They <strong>have not been playing</strong> football since morning.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Have</strong> they <strong>been playing</strong> football since morning?</p>
    <p>The auxiliary “have” moves to the front in questions, but the verb form does not change.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- EXPLANATION FOR "We" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> We <strong>have been waiting</strong> for the bus for 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>The action began earlier and is still happening in the present.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Negative & Question Forms ❌❓</h4>
    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> We <strong>have not been waiting</strong> for the bus for 30 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Have</strong> we <strong>been waiting</strong> for the bus for 30 minutes?</p>
    <p>Use “have not been” for negatives; questions start with “Have”. The verb remains in V-ing.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- EXPLANATION FOR "She" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> She <strong>has been reading</strong> that book all week.</p>

    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> She <strong>has not been reading</strong> that book all week.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Has</strong> she <strong>been reading</strong> that book all week?</p>
    <p>For “she/he/it”, always use <strong>has</strong>. Structure stays: has + been + V-ing.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- EXPLANATION FOR "He" -->
<section class="verb-section">
  <div class="verb-card">
    <h4>Positive Form ✅</h4>

    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> He <strong>has not been working</strong> on his project since morning.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Has</strong> he <strong>been working</strong> on his project since morning?</p>
    <p>Just like “she” and “it”, questions start with “Has”, and the verb remains in V-ing form.</p>
  </div>
</section>

    <p><strong>Negative:</strong> It <strong>has not been raining</strong> since early morning.</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <strong>Has</strong> it <strong>been raining</strong> since early morning?</p>
    <p>Use “has” for singular subjects, and keep the verb in been + V-ing form in all structures.</p>
