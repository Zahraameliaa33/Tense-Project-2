    Who Uses Have/Has in Present Perfect Continuous?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Present Perfect Continuous, <strong>have</strong> and <strong>has</strong> carry the present connection.  
    The main verb always takes the form <strong>been + V-ing</strong>.  
    You never worry about regular or irregular verbs because the verb stays in the <strong>-ing</strong> form.  
    This tense shows an action that started in the past and is still continuing now or has just stopped.

<!-- Present Perfect Continuous Pattern Explanation -->
<section class="intro">
  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Present Perfect Continuous Patterns</h3>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + have/has + been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Have/has” gives the present link.  
      “Been” connects the subject to the action.  
      The main verb stays in <strong>-ing</strong> form because the action is ongoing.  
      This tense focuses on the <strong>duration</strong> of the activity.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>  
      I have been studying 📖,  
      She has been cooking 🍳,  
      They have been waiting ⏳  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + have/has + not + been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Have/has” stays as the helper.  
      “Not” blocks the action.  
      The verb continues in its <strong>-ing</strong> form.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Switch idea:</strong></p>
    <p>
      ◼️ <strong>Have/Has</strong>: “I connect the action to now.”<br>
      ◼️ <strong>Been</strong>: “I mark continuity.”<br>
      ◼️ <strong>V-ing</strong>: “I show the ongoing action.”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Have/Has + S + been + V-ing?</p>

    <p>
      For questions, “have/has” moves to the front.  
      “Been” stays after the subject.  
      The main verb remains in <strong>-ing</strong> form.  
      This form asks about actions that started in the past and continue now.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>  
      Have I been eating 🍎?  
      Has she been studying 📚?  
      Have they been waiting ⏳?  
    </p>
