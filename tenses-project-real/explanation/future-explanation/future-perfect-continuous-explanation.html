    Who Uses "Will Have Been" in Future Perfect Continuous?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Future Perfect Continuous, <strong>will have been</strong> expresses an action 
    that will still be in progress <strong>up to a specific point in the future</strong>.  
    The main verb always stays in <strong>V-ing</strong> form so there is <strong>no need</strong> 
    to think about regular or irregular verbs.  
    Every subject (I, you, we, they, he, she, it) uses the <strong>same structure</strong>.

  <div class="time-card" style="flex:1 1 200px;">
    <h4><strong>WILL HAVE BEEN + V-ING (ALL SUBJECTS) ✅</strong></h4>

    <p>I <strong>will have been studying</strong> for 3 hours by tonight 📘.</p>
    <p>You <strong>will have been working</strong> all day by 6 PM 💻.</p>
    <p>We <strong>will have been traveling</strong> for 10 hours by noon ✈️.</p>
    <p>They <strong>will have been running</strong> for an hour by the time we arrive 🏃‍♂️.</p>
    <p>She <strong>will have been cooking</strong> since morning by lunchtime 🍳.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Future Perfect Continuous Patterns</h3>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + will + have been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Will” shows the future.  
      “Have been” connects the subject to the duration.  
      The main verb stays in <strong>-ing</strong> form because the action is still ongoing.  
      This tense focuses on how long the action will have continued before a future time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>  
      I will have been working 💻,  
      She will have been sleeping 😴,  
      They will have been waiting ⏳  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + will + not + have been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Will not” blocks the future progress.  
      The structure <strong>does not change</strong> for any subject.  
      The verb stays in <strong>V-ing</strong> form.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Switch idea:</strong></p>
    <p>
      ◼️ <strong>Will</strong>: “I show the future.”<br>
      ◼️ <strong>Have been</strong>: “I show the duration.”<br>
      ◼️ <strong>V-ing</strong>: “I show the ongoing action.”  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Will + S + have been + V-ing?</p>

    <p>
      For questions, “will” moves to the front.  
      The main verb stays in <strong>-ing</strong> form.  
      This structure asks how long the action will have continued before a future time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>  
      Will I have been studying 📖?  
      Will she have been cooking 🍳?  
      Will they have been waiting ⏳?  
    </p>
  </div>
