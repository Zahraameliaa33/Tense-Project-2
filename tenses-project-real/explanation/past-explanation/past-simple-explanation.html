  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">What is Simple Tense?</h3>
  <p>
    The Simple Tense is used to describe actions that happen regularly, happened in the past, or will happen in the future. 
    It shows the action clearly without extra focus on progress or completion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Positive:</strong> Just use the verb form:
    <em>V1</em> (present), <em>V2</em> (past), or <em>will + V1</em> (future).<br>
    <strong>Negative:</strong> Add <em>do/does/did + not + base verb</em>.<br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Use <em>Do/Does/Did + subject + base verb?</em>
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
    ✅ <strong>Mark for Simple Tense:</strong> Look for time words like <em>every day, always, sometimes, yesterday, ago, tomorrow</em>. 
    These show the action is simple happens, happened, or will happen.

  <!-- Pattern Explanation -->

  
  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + V2</p>

  <p>
    There is no helping verb here.  
    The verb itself carries the past.  
    The “past” lives inside the verb form.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> I went, She ate, They played</p>
</div>

<div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + did + not + V1</p>

  <p>
    When “did” appears, the main verb returns to V1.  
    “Did” is the one holding the past, not the verb itself.  
    The past moves into the helper.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Switch idea:</strong></p>
  <p>
    ◼️ <strong>Did</strong>: “I hold the past.”  
    ◼️ <strong>Main verb</strong>: “Then I stay in V1.”
  </p>
</div>

<div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Did + S + V1?</p>

  <p>
    Same rule: “did” carries the past.  
    The main verb remains clean in V1.  
    In questions, “did” simply moves to the front to ask.
  </p>

<!-- SIMPLE PAST -->
<section class="tip-card">
  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Simple Past Tense ⏳</h3>
  <p>
    The Simple Past tense is used to talk about actions or events that happened at a specific time in the past. 
    It shows that something is finished and no longer happening. To form the positive sentence, we usually add 
    <strong>-ed</strong> to regular verbs (e.g., <em>walk → walked</em>) or use the second form of irregular verbs 
    (e.g., <em>go → went</em>). For negative sentences, we use <strong>did not + base verb</strong> (e.g., 
    <em>did not go</em>). To ask a question, we use <strong>Did + subject + base verb?</strong> (e.g., 
    <em>Did you study yesterday?</em>).
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
    ✅ <strong>Mark for Simple Past:</strong> Look for words like <em>yesterday, last night, ago, in 2010</em>. 
    These show the action happened in the past.
  </p>

<!-- PAST SIMPLE EXPLANATION -->
<section class="tip-card">
  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">💡 Past Simple quick guide</h3>
  <p>
    Use the Past Simple to talk about completed actions in the past.  
    Example ideas: one-time events, a sequence of actions, or habits in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make the past form: regular verbs add <strong>-ed</strong> (walk → walked), and irregular verbs have their own special forms (go → went).  
    Short rules (easy): <em>play → played</em>, <em>finish → finished</em>, <em>eat → ate</em>.
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
    ✅ <strong>Common uses:</strong> one completed action (I ate dinner), a series of events (She woke up, brushed her teeth, and left), past habits (He played football every weekend).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="tip-card intro-card">
<h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Why do negative and interrogative forms use Verb 1?</h3>
 <p>
   Because the past meaning is already carried by the helping verb <strong>“did”</strong>.  
    Once “did” appears, the main verb must return to its base form (Verb 1).  
    <br><br>
    👉 <em>Positive:</em> She <strong>went</strong> to school. (past = verb carries it)<br>
    👉 <em>Negative:</em> She <strong>did not go</strong> to school. (past = “did”, so verb goes back to V1)<br>
    👉 <em>Question:</em> <strong>Did</strong> she <strong>go</strong> to school?  
    <br><br>
    ✨ “Did” already marks the past that’s why the main verb never changes in negative and interrogative forms.
     <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
    ✅ <strong>Helping verb (auxiliary verb):</strong> a “helper word” used with another verb to make a sentence.  
  It doesn’t show the action it just helps the sentence work.  
  Examples: <em>do, does, did, is, was, were, will</em>.

  <p>
    Now that you understand how the Simple Past works, there’s one more thing you must know:
    <strong>not all verbs change the same way in the past.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    When you make a <strong>positive</strong> sentence in Simple Past, you use the <strong>past form of the verb (V2)</strong>.

    Why Time Expressions Matter?
  </h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Time expressions</strong> tell us when something happened. In Simple Past, they help us know that an action is finished and happened before now.  
    Some common time words are <em>yesterday, last night, ago, in 2010, when I was a child, once, then, at that time</em>.  
    By looking for these words, you can easily use the Simple Past correctly and talk about things that already happened.

<section class="why-matters">
  <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Why Simple Past Matters?
  </h3>

  <p>
    The <strong>Simple Past</strong> is used to talk about actions or events that already happened. We use <em>-ed</em> for regular verbs and special forms for irregular verbs. Time words like <strong>yesterday, last night, ago</strong> help us know when the action took place.
  </p>
  <p>
    By paying attention to the verb forms and the time expressions, you can easily tell stories, share experiences, and describe past events in English. Remember, looking for the time words is the easiest way to know when to use the Simple Past.
