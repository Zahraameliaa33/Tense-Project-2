      This section explains the <strong>Past Continuous</strong> in English. It also called as (Past Progressive) 
      you’ll learn how to use it to talk about actions that were happening at a specific time in the past
      actions that were in progress, interrupted actions, and two things happening at the same time.

  <!-- WHAT IS PAST CONTINUOUS -->
  <section class="tip-card">
    <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">What is Past Continuous?</h3>
    <p>
      The Past Continuous shows actions that were in progress at a certain time in the past.  
      It tells us: "something was happening" not finished, but happening then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Positive:</strong> <em>S + was/were + V-ing</em>.<br>
      <strong>Negative:</strong> <em>S + was/were + not + V-ing</em>.<br>
      <strong>Question:</strong> <em>Was/Were + S + V-ing?</em>
    </p>
    <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
      ✅ <strong>Mark for Past Continuous:</strong> Look for words like <em>while, at 5 PM, all morning, when</em>.  
      These often show an action was ongoing at a specific past time.

    Who Uses Was and Were?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Past Continuous, <strong>was</strong> and <strong>were</strong> carry the past tense.  
    Choosing the right helper verb ensures your sentence is correct.  
    The main verb always stays in -ing form.

    <h4><strong>WAS ✅</strong> (singular subjects)</h4>
    <p>I <strong>was</strong> eating 🍎.</p>
    <p>He <strong>was</strong> running 🏃‍♂️.</p>
    <p>She <strong>was</strong> cooking 🍳.</p>
    <p>It <strong>was</strong> raining 🌧️.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Past Continuous Patterns</h3>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + was/were + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      The past is carried by the helping verb <strong>was/were</strong>.  
      The main verb itself stays in the -ing form, never changing for regular or irregular.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> I was eating 🍎, She was going ✈️, They were playing ⚽</p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + was/were + not + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Not” negates the action.  
      <strong>Was/were</strong> still carries the past; the main verb remains in -ing form.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> I was not eating 🍎, She was not going ✈️, They were not playing ⚽</p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Was/Were + S + V-ing?</p>

    <p>
      For questions, the helping verb <strong>was/were</strong> moves to the front.  
      The main verb still stays in -ing, and the past is fully handled by the helper.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Was I eating 🍎? Was she going ✈️? Were they playing ⚽?</p>

  <!-- PAST CONTINUOUS EXPLANATION -->
  <section class="tip-card">
    <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">💡 Past Continuous quick guide</h3>
    <p>
      Use the Past Continuous to talk about something that was happening at a particular time in the past.
      Example ideas: an action in progress, an action interrupted by another event, or two actions happening at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the <em>V-ing</em> form: usually add <strong>-ing</strong> to the base verb (walk → walking).  
      Short rules (easy): <em>make → making</em>, <em>stop → stopping</em> (double last consonant if needed), <em>have → having</em> (drop final -e).
    </p>
    <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
      ✅ <strong>Common uses:</strong> action in progress (at 7pm yesterday), interrupted action (I was sleeping when the phone rang), two actions together (She was cooking while he was reading).

      Why Past Continuous Matters
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <strong>Past Continuous</strong> helps you describe actions that were happening at a specific time in the past.
      Use it to show an action in progress, something interrupted, or two things happening at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noticing time words like <strong>at 7pm, while, when, all morning</strong>, you can choose Past Continuous and tell clearer, smoother stories about the past.
