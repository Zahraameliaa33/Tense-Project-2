    <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">What is Past Perfect Continuous?</h3>
    <p>
      The Past Perfect Continuous (also called "had been + -ing") shows an action that was happening for a period of time before another past action.
      Think: someone <em>had been doing</em> something, and then something else happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Positive:</strong> <em>S + had been + V-ing</em>.<br />
      <strong>Negative:</strong> <em>S + had not been + V-ing</em>.<br />
      <strong>Question:</strong> <em>Had + S + been + V-ing?</em>
    </p>

    <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
      ✅ <strong>Mark for Past Perfect Continuous:</strong> Look for words like <em>for, since, how long, by the time</em>.  
      These often show duration or that something had been happening before another past moment.

<!-- Past Perfect Continuous Pattern Explanation -->
<section class="intro">
  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Past Perfect Continuous Patterns</h3>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + had + been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Had been” is the helper that carries the past.  
      The main verb takes its <strong>-ing</strong> form.  
      The past and duration of the action are fully expressed by “had been”.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> I had been eating 🍎, She had been going ✈️, They had been playing ⚽</p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + had + not + been + V-ing</p>

    <p>
      “Had been” still carries the past.  
      “Not” negates the action.  
      The main verb stays in <strong>-ing</strong> form.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Switch idea:</strong></p>
    <p>
      ◼️ <strong>Had been</strong>: “I hold the past & continuity.”  
      ◼️ <strong>Main verb (-ing)</strong>: “Then I stay in ongoing form.”  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

    <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Had + S + been + V-ing?</p>

    <p>
      For questions, “had been” moves to the front.  
      The main verb remains in <strong>-ing</strong>, expressing ongoing past action.  
    </p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Had I been eating 🍎? Had she been going ✈️? Had they been playing ⚽?</p>
