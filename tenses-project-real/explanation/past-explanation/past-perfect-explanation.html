  <!-- WHAT IS PAST PERFECT -->
  <section class="tip-card">
    <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">What is Past Perfect?</h3>
    <p>
      The Past Perfect shows that one action was finished before another action in the past.
      Think: <em>"had done" first then something else happened.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Positive:</strong> <em>S + had + V3 (past participle)</em>.<br />
      <strong>Negative:</strong> <em>S + had + not + V3</em>.<br />
      <strong>Question:</strong> <em>Had + S + V3?</em>
    </p>

    <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
      ✅ <strong>Mark for Past Perfect:</strong> Look for words like <em>already, before, by the time, by + (time), just, yet</em>.  
      They often show that something happened earlier than another past event.

    Who Uses Had in Past Perfect?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Past Perfect, <strong>had</strong> carries the past tense for <strong>all subjects</strong>.  
    The main verb always stays in its <strong>past participle (V3) form</strong>, so you don’t need to worry about regular or irregular verbs.  
    Using <strong>had</strong> correctly shows which action happened first in the past.

    <h4><strong>HAD ✅</strong> (all subjects)</h4>
    <p>I <strong>had eaten</strong> 🍎.</p>
    <p>You <strong>had left</strong> 🚶‍♀️.</p>
    <p>He <strong>had finished</strong> homework 📚.</p>
    <p>She <strong>had studied</strong> for the test 📖.</p>

    <!-- Past Perfect Pattern Explanation -->
 <section class="intro">
  <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">Past Perfect Patterns</h3>
<div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>1️⃣ POSITIVE (Affirmative)</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + had + V3</p>

  <p>
    “Had” is the helper that carries the past.  
    The main verb takes its <strong>past participle (V3)</strong> form.  
    The past is fully handled by “had”.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> I had eaten 🍎, She had gone ✈️, They had finished ⚽</p>
</div>

<div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>2️⃣ NEGATIVE</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> S + had + not + V3</p>

  <p>
    “Had” still carries the past.  
    “Not” negates the action.  
    The main verb stays in V3 form.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Switch idea:</strong></p>
  <p>
    ◼️ <strong>Had</strong>: “I hold the past.”  
    ◼️ <strong>Main verb (V3)</strong>: “Then I stay in past participle form.”  
  </p>
</div>

<div class="time-card" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
  <h4>3️⃣ QUESTION</h4>

  <p>🔸 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Had + S + V3?</p>

  <p>
    For questions, “had” moves to the front.  
    The main verb remains in **V3**, and “had” continues to carry the past.  
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Had I eaten 🍎? Had she gone ✈️? Had they finished ⚽?</p>

  <!-- PAST PERFECT QUICK GUIDE -->
  <section class="tip-card">
    <h3 style="color:#2196F3;">💡 Past Perfect quick guide</h3>
    <p>
      Use Past Perfect when you want to show that one past action happened <strong>before</strong> another past action.
      Example idea: <em>He had left before I arrived.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How to form V3 (easy):</strong> Regular verbs: add <em>-ed</em> (walk → walked → walked).  
      Irregular verbs: the past participle is different (go → went → gone). Learn a few common ones slowly.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color:#f0f8ff; padding:8px; border-left:4px solid #2196F3;">
      ✅ <strong>Common uses:</strong> show order (first / earlier action), report feelings or results (she had finished, so she felt calm).
